## Getting Started

This section guides you through setting up and running the chatbot.

### Prerequisites

* **[.NET SDK 7.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download):** Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system.  This provides the necessary tools to build and run the application.

### Installation

There are a couple of ways to get the chatbot code:

1.  **Cloning the Repository (Recommended):**

    If you're using Git, the easiest way is to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ST10437798E/https://github.com/ST10437798/partTwoChatbotPOE.git.git](https://github.com/ST10437798/https://github.com/ST10437798/partTwoChatbotPOE.git.git)
    cd https://github.com/ST10437798/partTwoChatbotPOE.git
    ```

    This will download the code to your computer and navigate you to the project directory.  Replace  `ST10437798`  and  `https://github.com/ST10437798/partTwoChatbotPOE.git`  with the actual username and repository name.

2.  **Manual Setup:**

    If you prefer not to use Git, you can set up the project manually:

    * Create a new console application project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code with the C# extension).
    * Create two C# files:  `EnhancedResponseSystem.cs`  and  `Program.cs`.
    * Copy the code from the corresponding files in this repository into your newly created files.
    * Ensure that your project targets .NET 7.0 or later.

### Running the Application

Once you have the code, you can run the chatbot:

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory (the directory containing the `.csproj` file).

2.  **Build the application:**

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

    This command compiles the C# code into an executable.

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    This will start the chatbot.

### Usage

Interacting with the chatbot is straightforward:

1.  **Initial Startup:**

    * When you run the application, the chatbot will first try to display ASCII art from a file located at  `~/Downloads/ascii-art.txt`.  If this file is not found, it will display a default text-based header.
    * You will then be prompted to enter your name.  This is used for a more personalized greeting.

2.  **Conversation:**

    * After the greeting, the chatbot will present a list of example questions and topics to help you get started.
    * You can then type your questions or statements into the console and press Enter.  The chatbot will process your input and provide a response.
    * The chatbot is designed to handle a variety of inputs, including:
        * Direct questions about cybersecurity topics.
        * Requests for information using keywords.
        * Follow-up questions to clarify previous responses.
        * Expressions of feelings or concerns related to cybersecurity.

3.  **Ending the Conversation:**

    * To end your session with the chatbot, simply press Enter without typing any text when prompted with  `You:`.

## Code Structure

The chatbot's code is organized into two main C# files:

* **`EnhancedResponseSystem.cs`:**

    This file contains the  `EnhancedResponseSystem`  class, which encapsulates the core logic of the chatbot.  It is responsible for:

    * Storing the chatbot's knowledge base, including:
        * `keywordResponses`:  A dictionary mapping keywords to lists of relevant responses.
        * `topicResponses`:  A dictionary mapping cybersecurity topics to lists of detailed explanations.
        * `responses`:  A dictionary mapping specific questions to their corresponding answers.
        * `sentimentMap`:  A dictionary mapping sentiment-related keywords to  `SentimentResponse`  objects.
    * Defining the  `Sentiment`  enum and the  `SentimentResponse`  class to handle sentiment analysis.
    * Implementing the  `GetResponse`  method, which is the heart of the chatbot.  This method takes user input, analyzes it, and returns the appropriate response.
    * Providing methods for formatting the console output:  `DisplayHeader`,  `DisplayDivider`, and  `TypeWriterEffect`.

* **`Program.cs`:**

    This file contains the  `Program`  class, which serves as the entry point of the application.  It handles:

    * Creating an instance of the  `EnhancedResponseSystem`  class.
    * Attempting to load and display ASCII art from a file.
    * Managing the main conversation loop, where the application continuously reads user input and displays chatbot responses.
    * Implementing error handling for file operations and other potential exceptions.

## Extensibility

The chatbot's design makes it relatively easy to extend its functionality:

* **Adding More Knowledge:** You can expand the chatbot's knowledge base by adding more entries to the  `keywordResponses`,  `topicResponses`, and  `responses`  dictionaries.
* **Improving Responses:** You can modify the existing responses or add new ones to provide more detailed or nuanced information.
* **Enhancing Sentiment Analysis:** You can add more sentiment keywords and responses to improve the chatbot's ability to understand user emotions.
* **Integrating New Features:** You can add new methods to the  `EnhancedResponseSystem`  class to implement additional features, such as:
    * More sophisticated context management.
    * Integration with external data sources.
    * User profiles or preferences.

## Potential Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future development:

* **Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Integrate an NLP library (e.g.,  [Microsoft.ML](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/docs/machinelearning/)) to enable the chatbot to better understand the meaning and intent behind user input.  This would allow for more flexible and natural conversations.
* **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis:** Implement a more robust sentiment analysis technique to provide more accurate and contextually relevant emotional responses.
* **Conversation History:** Add the ability to store and retrieve conversation history, allowing the chatbot to remember previous interactions and provide more personalized responses.
* **User Profiles:** Implement user profiles to allow users to customize the chatbot's behavior or the type of information they receive.
* **External Data Integration:** Connect the chatbot to external APIs or databases to provide access to real-time cybersecurity news, threat intelligence, or other relevant information.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Develop a graphical user interface (e.g., using  [WPF](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/wpf)  or  [MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui)) to provide a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
* **Logging:** Implement logging to track conversations, errors, and other events, which can be helpful for debugging and improving the chatbot.
* **Unit Testing:** Add unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the chatbot's code.
